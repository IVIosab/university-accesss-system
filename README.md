Special cases : Emeregency Declaration : Anyone can call an emergency where all rooms will be opened for everyone. Only the admin can stop the emergency.

Example of using the program : first pick which user are you from the list then if you picked an admin you will have to enter a password otherwise you won't the program will display your information then will ask you what action do you want to do if you are an admin there is 4 actions 1-access a room 2-grant access to a room for a user 3-change the level access of user 4-stop an emergency if you are not an admin there is only 2 actions 1-access a room 2-declare an emergency

if you try to access a room and your level isn't high enough for it the program will display : "you can't access this room" other wise it'll display : "Access granted"
